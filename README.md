- ü§ñ Supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI-compatible APIs)
- üéß Audio feedback for recording start/stop
- üßÆ Dynamic noise floor calculation for better recording quality

## Usage

Once you have the ojut server running in the background, here is what
a sample workflow would look like:

- Focus on the input field you want to type in
- Press the trigger key (currently ctrl+alt+cmd+u)
- Wait for audio cue
- Start speaking
- Release the trigger key
- Text gets typed out into the input field

## Configuration

You can specify the whisper model to use. This can be done via either the config
file or using CLI args. CLI args will override the value in the config file. We
currently only have support to specify the model, but will add more options in
the future.

### LLM Post-Processing

Ojut can optionally post-process transcribed text using an LLM for
better formatting and punctuation. This feature requires:

1. Setting up API credentials:
   ```sh
   export OJUT_LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # or use OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

2. Enabling in config or CLI:
   ```yaml
   post_process: true
   llm_system_prompt: "Cleanup the following transcript and add punctuation. Do not change anything else."
   ```

   Or via CLI:
   ```sh
   ojut --post-process
   ```

   You can customize the system prompt to modify how the LLM processes text. For example:

   To clean up speech mistakes and improve readability:
   ```yaml
   llm_system_prompt: >
     You are a transcription assistant. Your task is to:
     1. Correct any speech errors, stutters, or mispronunciations
     2. Add proper punctuation and capitalization
     3. Improve grammar while preserving the original meaning
     4. Remove filler words like "um", "uh", etc.
     5. Format the text into clear, coherent sentences
     Do not add any content that wasn't in the original transcript.
   ```

   For basic punctuation and formatting:
   ```yaml
   llm_system_prompt: >
     Clean up the following transcript by adding punctuation and capitalization.
     Do not change the wording or meaning of the text.
   ```

3. Optional environment variables:
   ```sh
   export OJUT_LLM_ENDPOINT="https://your-llm-endpoint"  # defaults to OpenAI (you can use any OpenAI compatible endpoint)
   export OJUT_LLM_MODEL="gpt-4o"  # defaults to gpt-4o-mini
   ```

### Dictionary

You can also specify a personal dictionary in the config file. This is a list of words that are specific to you. Ojut will prompt the model to recognize these words. Here is an example of what that would look like:

```yaml
dictionary:
  - Ojut
  - Golang
  - meain
```

Note that you have to restart the server for this to take effect.

Here is what the config file looks like:

```yaml
model: "medium.en-q8_0" # use "tiny.en-q8_0" if you have a slow machine
```

Here is how you would specify using the CLI:

```sh
ojut -model tiny.en-q8_0
```

You can also pass in an absolute path to a model file:

```
ojut -model "/path/to/models/tiny.en.bin"
```

FYI, the [models](https://keyboard.futo.org/voice-input-models) used in [FUTO keyboard](https://keyboard.futo.org/) seems to be pretty good.

_You can specify model as empty `ojut -model ""` to show a picker._

## Installation

> You also could run via the nix flake using `nix run github:meain/ojut`

- Install portaudio
- Install whisper-cpp (need to be available in path)
- Install ojut (go install github.com/meain/ojut@latest)

## What is with the name?

I'm glad you asked. It's very stupid but here is how I got to the
name. "Dictation" in Japanese is "Âè£Ëø∞Á≠ÜË®ò" which sounds like "K≈çjutsu
hikki". Now I just took part of the first word "ojut". It was unique
enough and I was tired of looking for the name and so I decided I'm
just going to use it.
